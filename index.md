## Patent-pending Surrogate Soundboard System

My BS Thesis in Applied Physics from Yale University develops a patent-pending mechanism for transferring acoustic vibrations from a live violin to a remote violin using custom-fabricated transducers and digital inverse filters. A version of my thesis appears as a paper in [ICMC 2016](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ywxxt5kxx49h3z/ICMC%20Surrogate%20L.%20Hantrakul%202016.pdf?dl=0). Full documentation available [here](http://cargocollective.com/lh-hantrakul/Surrogate-Soundboards-Mark-II)

## Fidular

_Fidular_ is a patent-pending and award-winning cross-cultural modular fiddle system, placing in the top 5% of designs at [A' Design Awards](https://competition.adesignaward.com/design.php?ID=50765) and winning Student Runner Up to the [Core 77 Design Awards](http://designawards.core77.com/Open-Design/64638/Fidular-Modular-Fiddle-System). It enables musicians and luthiers to detach and interchange components such as strings and chambers between fiddles from across the Asia and the Middle East. A print of this design is currently in special exhibition at the [Musical Instruments Museum](https://mim.org/) in Phoenix, AZ and accepted to [NIME 2017 conference](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3mfkh3yc6ul5qlm/L%20Hantrakul%20NIME16%20Fidular%20UPLOAD.pdf?dl=0).
